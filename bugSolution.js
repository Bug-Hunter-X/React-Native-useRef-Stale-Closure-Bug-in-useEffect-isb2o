To solve this problem, ensure that you're accessing the ref only when its value is available and up-to-date.  One effective way to handle this is to use a state variable to track whether the component is mounted:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsMounted(true);
    return () => setIsMounted(false);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isMounted && inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, [isMounted, inputRef.current]);

  return (
    <TextInput ref={inputRef} />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

By using `isMounted` to control access to `inputRef.current`, we ensure the ref is accessed only after the component is mounted and only if the ref has been initialized. The cleanup function in the first `useEffect` also properly handles unmounting to prevent potential issues.
